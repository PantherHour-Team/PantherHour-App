# PantherHour
The Panther Hour app.


## Application Concept: <br>
The Panther Hour mobile app is a management tool for Annapolis High School students and teachers to coordinate and plan their activities during Panther Hour - a time during the school day where students have control over how they spend it.

There are two account types for students and teachers which will work together to simplify the process of signing up for activities, managing a schedule, and providing oversight of the students. Student accounts have the ability to select activities, such as clubs or course help, and create an individual schedule for the duration of Panther Hour. Teachers have the ability to create and manage activities, determine the rooms they take place in, set the duration of the activities, and set the capacities. Teachers also have admin priveleges for checking on the students to ensure they are signing up for activities before and during Panther Hour.

The Pather Hour app is an efficient solution that is capable of being applied to any high school with a self directed period during the school day.
