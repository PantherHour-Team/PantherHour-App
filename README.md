## Application Concept: <br>
The Panther Hour mobile app is a management tool for high school students and teachers to coordinate and plan their school activities. There are two account types for students and teachers which will work together to request and approve activities to ensure all students are accounted for and are properly supervised. Students will be able to book rooms based on available time slots during Panther Hour. Student accounts will have the ability to select activities such as clubs, self study, or course help and specify the location they will be participating at. After making a request and getting teacher approval, students can continue with their schedule for the duration of Panther Hour.
